    <p>
      I always liked to build things, so I learned to build software. My business degree never hurts in understanding
      feature initiatives and functionality. Best content as a jack of all trades, I've been a full-stack developer
      since
      2015.

      I built this website primarily to render markdown files (_my preferred syntax_). I created these [Guides]() for
      myself, but I hope someone else finds them useful too.

      The following are maxims I live by, which characterize my mission and core values.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>I'll never know everything. I'll always be acquiring skills. A day I learn nothing is a day I wasted.</li>
      <li>I learn from those who lived before me. I study their stories. I'm prepared when history repeats itself.</li>
      <li>I hear jokes every day. I make someone laugh every day. Pleasing others makes life worthwhile.</li>
      <li>My faith is in the scientific method. I won't believe what can't be proven. I question everything.</li>
      <li>My greatest virtues are patience and diligence; I exercise them daily.</li>
      <li>I don't look back: I look ahead. My past is just prologue.</li>
      <li>In whatever I do, I contribute focus, wit, congeniality, and dedication.</li>
    </ol>
