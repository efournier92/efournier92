    I always liked to build things, so I learned to build software. My business degree never hurts in understanding
    feature initiatives and functionality. Best content as a jack of all trades, I've been a full-stack developer since
    2015.

    I built this website primarily to render markdown files (_my preferred syntax_). I created these [Guides]() for
    myself, but I hope someone else finds them useful too.

    The following are maxims I live by, which characterize my mission and core values.
    1. I'll never know everything. I'll always be acquiring skills. A day I learn nothing is a day I wasted.
    2. I learn from those who lived before me. I study their stories. I'm prepared when history repeats itself.
    3. I hear jokes every day. I make someone laugh every day. Pleasing others makes life worthwhile.
    4. My faith is in the scientific method. I won't believe what can't be proven. I question everything.
    5. My greatest virtues are patience and diligence; I exercise them daily.
    6. I don't look back: I look ahead. My past is just prologue.
    7. In whatever I do, I contribute focus, wit, congeniality, and dedication.
